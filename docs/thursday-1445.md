ðŸ”¥ ESCALATION UPDATE ðŸ”¥

TIME: Thursday, 2:45 PM ~ 1 hour after initial incident reported
SITUATION DEVELOPMENT: Partial progress made, but new pressures emerging

TECHNICAL UPDATE:
â€¢ Initial fix implemented - pipeline is now running
â€¢ Dashboard showing some data, but still missing 40% of daily records
â€¢ Data validation issue partially resolved, but root cause still unclear
â€¢ Estimated 2 more hours needed for complete data backfill and validation

STAKEHOLDER ESCALATION:
â€¢ BOARD MEETING HAPPENED: Sales Director had to present incomplete numbers
â€¢ CEO now directly involved: "I need to understand what went wrong and when it will be fixed"
â€¢ Legal team contacted: Premium client Acme Corp formally complained about SLA breach
â€¢ Marketing Director: "Our biggest product launch campaign data is missing - this is a disaster"

NEW COMPLICATIONS:
â€¢ Data Protection Officer asking: "Do we need to report this as a data incident?"

IMMEDIATE DECISIONS NEEDED:
1. CEO wants personal briefing in 30 minutes - what do you tell them?
2. Legal team needs to know: Is this an SLA breach requiring customer compensation?
3. Communications team asking: Do we issue public statement or keep it internal?
4. Technical decision: Continue current fix or implement faster workaround?
